### 1. Modeling scenarios

For each of parts a) through d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

  a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.

  b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.

  c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.

  d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Var(ε), is extremely high.
